# Springer covid19 free books downloader
I'm working as teacher on a python development course for beginners.

That program is a quick and dirty program aimed to show to the students how to develop a crawler that download books from a webpage, in this case, the Springer covid19 free books webpage.

Feel free to collaborate if you think something could be improved. 

## Requirements
Python versions supported:
- python 3+

Is strongly recommended to install the requirements into a virtual environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
That program download all the free books into a folder called 'books'.

To run the program execute the next command:
```bash
python3 downloader.py
```
